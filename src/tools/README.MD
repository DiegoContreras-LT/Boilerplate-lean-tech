In these templates are implemented different tools that could be necessary in a React project:

COOKIE FOLDER


STORAGE FOLDER
It contains the implementation of the main methods to handle local storage, like load, save, remove, clear, and persist.


REST VALIDATOR FILE
It handles the responses on an API call, so it is possible to make custom validations and use them in the services classes.
